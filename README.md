Project 13, Mobile App using React Native, build during Technigo Bootcamp fall 2019!

## 1. What is this?

In this week's project, we used React native to build a mobile application, fetching data from an API to randomly show different movies. 

## 2. What did I do?
In this project I used the same API as previous project to build an app that gives you suggestions for different movies fetched from an open API from imdb website. And every time you interact, pressing the button, it will automatically give you a new movie as a suggestion. In this project we have been using styled components instead of css in js, to see how you can use the same syntax for css even though you are using a styled component. I have used the components View, Text and Image to create the app and learned alot more about the react native syntax. If I would have more time on this project, I would have added more details about the specific movie, even links to where to find it, I would have also experimented more with more components and interactions with the mobile, maybe alerts and vibrations, and also tried to make the Activityindicator more visible.

## 3. Where can you see it in action?
